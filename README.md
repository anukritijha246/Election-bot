The Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
 are a set of norms given by the Election Commission (EC) which regulate electioneering during elections. But lately the Election Commission has not been able to control unjust campaigning and hate speeches being propagated on social media.
<br />My aim is to make a chatbot which would help common citizens in assisting the EC to prevent this injustice. This chatbot would be hosted on Telegram where the users would be able to upload media links of hate speeches, pictures, or anything else which they think can sway voters in the wrong direction. Using Telegram for this would ensure that we already have a large number of users and making a chatbot would increase convenience in interaction.
<br />Since political parties might try to manipulate complaints of violations of MCC, it is necessary that the database is secure and immutable. Hence, a blockchain would be apt. No change can be done to data after it is validated and included in the block.
First the voter must identify herself through her Aadhaar Card and then upload links or pictures with appropriate description of area and political party involved. This chatbot would certainly help the EC in imposing social media regulations and maintain the norms of MCC in ensuring free and fair elections.<br />
